Working on my Terraform Project!

Goal is to have a basic AWS infrastructure with reusable modules. 

Things to have:
- VPC w/ public/private subnets
- EC2 instance in a public subnet
- RDS instance in private subnet
- IAM role and policy for EC2 to access S3
- S3 bucket w/ versioning enabled
- Outputs and variables cleanly defined
